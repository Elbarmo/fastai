# Lesson1-2

The objetive of these lessons of the [fastai course](http://course.fast.ai/index.html) is to make the students comfortable with some basic deep learning concepts. In particular, the idea is to train a model to make classification for two classes. In the lecture the example given is classifying into cats and dogs. For my case I try to classify two types of monkeys. The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species/home). I did not change the code further than adapting the paths so is the same as the one given by the instructors.
